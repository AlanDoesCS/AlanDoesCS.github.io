# Hi :)
## A little bit about me
- I'm a student about to enter first year Computer Science at Lancaster University.
- I love programming low level stuff with NASM/C/C++, and more general projects in Java and Python (and sometimes Go, too!!)

## My favourite projects
I've worked on quite a few random projects, some of which I've actually finished haha, but I did learn something new from each of them :)
